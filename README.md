# Maps #

Code to process free data from the Australian and Victorian (and possibly other) government web sites, and produce useful maps from that data.

## Contents ##

`mkmap` is a perlÂ 6 script to access a Postgresql database containing data available from various sources and generate a PostScript map of a particular area.

It's not perfect by any means, the main defect at the moment is that there are essentially no annotations related to data from VicMap, and all data is displayed no matter what scale you are generating, which makes small scale maps rather crowded.

## Database ##

The file Sources.md contains information on how to generate a base database from various sources.

## Symbols ##

You will need a set of symbols for the map. These are stored in a database table. Which table to use is specified at run time.

A default set of symbols is supplied. These are based on the symbols used for Australian 1:250000 and 1:100000 mapping, as described in "Symbol Dictionary for Topographic Map Production" produced by the National Mapping Division of Geoscience Australia in 2006 (currently available at http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/pdfs/v4nmdtoposymdicwww2.pdf).

These symbols are supplemented by some code in the mkmap script, particularly for asymmetric line symbology. A few symbols are not rendered correctly. Updates are welcome.

## Usage ##

`mkmap lat=dd.ddd long=ddd.ddd`

will produce PostScript on stdout (plus lots of progress information on stderr) which has the specified latitude and longitude at the bottom left hand corner.

Each script will process ~/.drawrc and .drawrc as a list of options before parsing the command line options. Options specified later will override earlier options.

Other options:

`papersize=a2` -- Generate   map for a particular sized sheet of paper. Available sizes include A0-A9, B0-B9, A-E and letter (default is A3).

`orientation=portrait`

`orientation=landscape` -- default

`bleedtop=1` -- bleed the map over the top margin (default is to stop the map short of the margin with longitude and easting information repeated above the map)

`bleedright=1` -- bleed the map over the right margin (default is to stop the map short of the margin with latitude and northing information repeated to the right of the map)

`annotation="dd.ddd dd.ddd xoff yoff text"` -- print the specified text in a box at location "dd.ddd dd.ddd" offset by xoff,yoff millimetres (default 10,10), with a line from the box to the specified location. The strings "$LONG" and "$LAT" will be replaced by the latitude and longitude of the annotation.

`leftmarginwidth=m.mm` -- the width of the left margin in millimetres (default 30).

`rightmarginwidth=m.mm` -- the width of the right margin in millimetres (default 30); ignored if bleedright is specified.

`lowermarginwidth=m.mm` -- the height of the bottom margin in millimetres (default 25).

`bottommarginwidth=m.mm` -- see lowermarginwidth

`uppermarginwidth=m.mm` -- the height of the top margin in millimetres (default 25); ignored if bleedtop is specified.

`topmarginwidth=m.mm` -- see uppermarginwidth

`database=&lt;db&gt;` -- The name of the Postgresql database to use (default "vicmap")

`db=&lt;db&gt;` -- see database

`latitude=dd.ddd` -- The latitude of the lower left corner of the map in decimal degrees. Negative is south of the equator.

`lat=dd.ddd` -- see latitude

`longitude=ddd.ddd` -- The longitude of the lower left corner of the map in decimal degrees. Negative is west of Greenwich.

`long=ddd.ddd` -- see longitude

`easting=mmmmmmm` -- The easting of the lower left corner of the map in metres. zone must also be specified.

`east=mmmmmmm` -- see easting

`northing=mmmmmmm` -- The northing of the lower left corner of the map in metres. The zone must also be specified.

`north=mmmmmm` -- see northing

`zone=55H` -- The UTM zone of the map. Must be specified if eastings and northings are specified for the lower left corner, otherwise defaults to the zone of the lower left corner.

`width=15m` -- The width of the map in decimal degrees (or decimal minutes if "m" appended).

`height=15m` -- The height of the map in decimal degrees (or decimal minutes if "m" appended).

`scale=30000` -- The scale of the map. (May be specified as 1:30000 also.) Defaults to 1:25000.

`gridspacing=1000m` -- The grid spacing on the map in metres (or km if "k" is appended). Defaults to 10km.

`grid=1000m` -- see gridspacing

`graticulespacing=2.5m` -- The graticule spacing in decimal degrees (or decimal minutes if "m" appended). Defaults to 0.25.

`graticule=2.5m` -- see graticulespacing

`display=all` -- Display all possible objects (see list below). This is the default.

`display=roads` -- Display the road information. (Used after nodisplay=all.) See below for complete list of what can be displayed.

`nodisplay=all` -- Don't display anything. Usually overridden by several display=??? options.

`nodisplay=roads` -- Don't display road information.

`nofeature=???` -- Don't display a featuretype.

`symbols=Symbols_GA` -- Which symbol set to use. Defaults to Symbols_GA which is probably the only symbol set which currently works.

`property=125342` -- Display the boundary of property number 125342. Determinig property number is left as an exercise for the reader.

`file=include.cfg` -- Process the specified file as options.
