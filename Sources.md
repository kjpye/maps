# Map data sources #

Note that most of the information below about unpacking the data and loading
the database is subsumed into the import/build-database script. You will only
need to unzip files where appropriate.

## GeoScience Australia 1:250000 ##

### Download the data ###
1. If you want data for the whole country, the easiest way is to search
for "geoscience australia digital topographic data". This will give you
options for various scales. The 1:250000 data is best handled at the moment,
but the others should also work. The 1:100000 data has certainly worked
in the past.
Selecting the 1:250000 option gives a set of download links.
(Usually. Refresh if necessary.)
Open the "esri pgdb" link. This will download a zip file about 1.3Gb
in size. Unzip it, and process the files in the Vector_data directory
as below.
2. If you want data for only a small part of the country, you can
download data for individual 1:250000 map sheets from data.gov.au
by searching for the name of the map and selecting the correct map:
'\<name\> 1:250000 GIS Dataset'. The search engine on data.gov.au
has recently changed, and you will find the data most easily by
searching for something like "mount young 1:250 000 gis dataset",
including the double quotes. Otherwise you will need to scroll through
a lot of irrelevant data before finding what you want.  An index of the
maps is available on data.gov.au as "Map Sheet / Data indexes 2012
(for 1:100 000, 1:250 000 and 1:1,000,000 scale maps)".
Click on "Download the file (pGDB).

If you also search for "mount young 1:250 000 topographic map" you will
be able to download an image of the map. I generally use the PDF version.

### Unpack the data and populate the database ###

You can unzip the resulting file and then process the data.

There are various scripts in the import directory which can be used to
process the data, which is in Microsoft's JET database format.
The make_gis script shows one way of doing this.

## NSW ##

Browse
https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/portal/apps/sites/#/home/pages/browse-data
and work your way down to the data. Try this for example...

1. Click on the graphic for "NSW Data Themes".

2. Click the grpahic or "Transport".

3. Find what you want. (There is an overriding "NSW Transport Theme" which
includes all data. It might be on the second page.) Click on the desired data.

4. Click on the text "Export Data" just below the header and access information.

5. Select the layers to export. If you want everything, change the pull-down
to "No thanks. I want to export data from all layers.". Click on "Next".

6. Select the area of the state you want. You can either draw the extent on
a map (the default), enter coordinates of the boundary, or export everything.

7. Select the format you want the data in. I have used "Esri shapefile"
because it's fast to get it into the database. Note the size limitations.
This will be a problem if you want the address data.

8. Select the datum -- either GDA94 or GDA2020.

9. Leave the coordinate system at the default "Geographic".

10. Enter your email address, and click on "Export".

11. Wait for an email with the download link.

Note that not all data has the "Export Data" option.
It's easy to tell -- those that do will have the words "Export Data"
at the beginning of the description. Sometimes there are multiple
similar options which appear to differ only in that one has the export
option.
For example, as I write this, under the Water theme,
there are two sets of data labelled "NSW Water Theme",
only one of which has the export option.
To make things even more difficult,
the one without the option is on the first page of results,
and the one with the option is alone on the second page.


## QTopo ##

Get Queensland topographic data by
   * going to https://qtopo.dnrm.qld.gov.au/QTopoUserGuide and selecting one of the options under "Layer List". There may be multiple datasets under each heading. If so, repeat the instructions below for each dataset you want.
   * Click on "Spatial Data". (If that option is not available, then the data is not available yet.)
   * Find the relevant product (usually the first).
   * Click on "Download dataset".
   * Select the data format ias "Shapefile" and change "As stored" to "WGS84 Geographic 2D".
   * Enter your email address
   * Accept the terms and conditions (after reading them); and
   * Click "Request download".
   * Close the pop-up window.

After some time you will get an email with a link to the data, which you can download and unzip.

You will need to repeat the whole exercise for each dataset you want.

## South Australia ##
Get South Australian topographic data by
   * Going to https://data.sa.gov.au
   * On the left hand menu, select "Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure" and "zip (shp)
   * Click on the desired dataset.
   * Click on the "Explore" button next to the shp version, and select "Go to resource".

Save the resultant file somewhere and unzip it.

## Tasmania ##
Try https://listdata.thelist.tas.gov.au/opendata.

Data for each dataset is available for each municipality. Each zip file contains data as shape files, ESRÎ™Pgdb files and Mapinfo files, so you'll be downloading three copies of everything.

Filenames appear to be https://listdata.thelist.tas.gov.au/opendata/data/LIST_<dataset>_<municipality>.zip.

Municipalities are

## VicMap ##
How to populate the VicMap database.

### Download the data ###

  * Go to https://service.land.vic.gov.au/SpatialDatamart and create an account for yourself. (This is not necessary, but useful.)
  * Goto Search, and enter what you want in the "what" field. Useful things are "tr_road", tr_rail", "hy_water", "el_ground", "el_contour" or just "vicmap".
  * Select the databases you want. The useful databases (i.e. those which the scripts know how to handle) include tr_road, tr_road_infrastructure, tr_road_locality, hy_water_area_polygon, hy_water_point, hy_water_struct_area_polygon, hy_water_struct_line, hy_water_struct_point, hy_watercourse, tr_rail, tr_rail_infrastructure, el_contour.
  * Clock on "proceed to order".
  * Select the area you want the data for. ("Whole of State" could generate rather large files, but they're manageable except for things like tree_density which contain great detail.) I usually use "Local Government Area" and wherever I'm interested in at the moment. (Note that the product of the number of datasets, and the number of areas must be no more then 12.)
  * Select the buffer zone (i.e. how far outside the selected area you want data for), the format ("ESRI shapefile"), projection ("_Geographicals on GDA-2020") and delivery method
  * Click on "Apply to All".
  * Now click "Submit", and "Submit" again.
  * When your order is ready, you will receive an email with the link to the data, which is valid for ten days. When the servers are busy this might take up to an hour or two. For very large database (Tree density for the whole state for example) you will be given a link to an ftp site which contains the files. Make sure you download data in the correct format.

### Unpack the data, and populate the database ###

  * Find a convenient directory and download the zip files to that directory.
  * Unzip the data.
  * Work out where the .shp files have been put.
  * Create a postgresql database: "createdb maps".
  * Ensure that postgis has been installed in that database.
  * For each shp file (except for things like EXTRACT_POLYGON which simply contains the boundary of the data you have), run "shp2pqsql -a -D -s 4326 \<shapefile\> [\<tablename\>] | psql maps", except, the first time you use a particular table, use "-c" instead of "-a". The tablename is optional, but I usually create the tables as vm_\<name\> to avoid conflicts. Some of the other code assumes this.
  * Fix up some database tables. The code assumes that certain types of tables have certain columns, and they don't always exist, so you need to create those columns with a default value, usually zero: "psql maps -c 'alter table tr_road_infrastructure add column width float default 0'". [Currently unnecessary]
  * You will also need to populate the database with the postscript definitions of all the symbols (the symbols_ga table) and the mapping from Vicmap objects to those symbols (the vicmap.symbols table): "psql -d maps -f mksymbols_ga" and "psql -d maps -f mkvicmap_symbols". These will both give errors the first time they are run as they delete and then recreate tables.

## Other states and territories

Î™ have been unable to find a way of downloading data for WA, NT and ACT. (WÎ‘ data is available, but costs real money.) Please let me know if you find a useful source.

## OpenStreetMap ##
The script can utilise OSM for displaying roads.

To download the data, try getting an extract fromn the osm database from somewhere, and running something like "osm2pgsql -l -d \<database\> ~/Downloads/australia.extract.osm.pbf".

I have used http://download.geofabrik.de/australia-oceania-latest.osm.pbf to get all of Australia.
